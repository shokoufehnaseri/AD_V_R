# Observations

1. Some columns, such as percentages (e.g., `Agricultural Land`, `CPI Change`), are stored as strings with symbols like `%` and may require conversion to numeric values for analysis.
2. Several columns contain missing values (`NA`), which may need imputation or handling during data preprocessing.
3. Monetary values (e.g., `GDP`, `Gasoline Price`, `Minimum Wage`) and tax rates may require standardization for cross-country comparisons.
4. Geospatial features (`Latitude`, `Longitude`) enable mapping or clustering based on geographic proximity.
